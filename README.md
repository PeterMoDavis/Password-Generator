# Password Generator

## Description

I wanted to use JavaScript to provide logic so that the App would generate a random password using guidelines submitted by the user. Now instead of the user having to come up with their own random passwords they can just type in their criteria and voila, a password is created. While making this project I utilized some of my skills to make what I consider a pretty concise bit of code. I tried to keep it DRY as possible and provided comments so that I could understand it easily. I also had to figure out some fairly confusing bugs involving "length" lacking a "- 1" that was throwing my number of characters out of whack. Also, renaming your Github repository is a pain!

## Usage

Just press the Generate Password button. Answer some questions and it will generate a password.
